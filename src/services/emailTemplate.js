  <p>Dear ${name},</p>

  <p>Thank you for your gift of $${amount} to Community Kitchens. Your support came at a critical time.
  Our meals are used to fill gaps left by other food support programs, to promote healthy lifestyles and
  connection to community, and to provide security and dignity for marginalized communities. Our meal
  programs support youth, low-income families and seniors and most importantly, our unhoused.</p>

  <p>Oakland has over 5,000 unhoused community members and while this population is growing,
  government support for meals has ended. Every day our unhoused residents are exposed to unsanitary
  and dangerous conditions and are vulnerable to serious health risks and significant safety hazards that
  threaten their lives. A warm meal is one way we can help.</p>

  <p><b>Your donation provides triple benefits:</b> keeping restaurants open, supporting local jobs and feeding our
  unhoused. Together we have provided over 200,000 meals to our community and over $2 million in
  revenue support for Oakland restaurants.</p>

  <p>Be assured our approach at Community Kitchens is rooted with core Oakland values and committed to
  food justice.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Equitable and Inclusive - We have a strong focus on emerging neighborhoods, ensuring
    restaurant support for marginalized communities and business owners of color.</li>

    <li>Meals with Dignity - Our restaurants serve the same meals they serve their customers or family.
    Not everyone has the means for a delicious, freshly prepared hot meal. At Community Kitchens
    there’s a place at the table for everyone.</li>

    <li>Bridging our Community Efficiently – We partner our restaurants with community groups that
    have established networks and volunteers supporting our unhoused communities.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thank you again for your generous contribution to our community.</p>

  <p>In solidarity,</p>
