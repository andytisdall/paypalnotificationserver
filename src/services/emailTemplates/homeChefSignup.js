  <p>Hi ${info.firstName},</p>

  <p>Thank you so much for your interest in becoming a CK Home Chef!  This program is a way to turn your home kitchen into a community kitchen.  We are grateful for the outpouring of volunteer interest since the CK Home Chef coverage was aired on KTVU Channel 2 News, and published on Oaklandside’s NOSH, Dishing on the East Bay. Check them out, they are both heartwarming stories that capture the spirit of our volunteer program and the people that receive meals.</p>

  <p>We will update you when we schedule our next CK Home Chef Orientation. In the meantime, I wanted to share some details about how our CK Home Chef Program works.</p>
  
  <p>As a CK Home Chef participant, you will:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Attend orientation and food safety certification training</li>
  <li>Sign up for a couple shifts a month to provide 25 meals</li>
  <li>Purchase ingredients and prepare meals at home</li>

  <p>We can answer questions and talk more about how this works in our next orientation.  If you would like to donate meals before then, Town Fridges are always open and free to the public. Be sure to include ingredients labeled with the date made.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you again for your commitment to making meals with love for our community.</p>
